# Introduction

## What are the main features of Java?

Java is a versatile programming language known for its wide array of features that make it a popular choice for developers. Here are the main features of Java:

### Main Features of Java

1. **Platform Independence:**
   Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This feature is often summarized by the phrase "write once, run anywhere."

2. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. This promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

3. **Simple Syntax:**
   Java's syntax is designed to be straightforward and similar to C++, making it easier for developers who are familiar with C-based languages to learn and use.

4. **Robust and Secure:**
   Java is designed to be robust with strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking. It also has built-in security features to protect against harmful code.

5. **Multi-threading:**
   Java provides built-in support for multi-threading, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently. This helps in efficiently managing multiple tasks at the same time.

6. **Automatic Memory Management:**
   Java uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory. This helps in preventing memory leaks and reduces the chances of memory-related errors.

7. **Rich Standard Library:**
   Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides many useful utilities and APIs for tasks such as file I/O, networking, data structures, and more.

8. **Network-Centric:**
   Java was designed with network programming in mind, making it easy to build and deploy network-based applications. It supports various network protocols and provides APIs for network communication.

### Example Code

The following Java class demonstrates a simple program that prints out the main features of Java:

```java
package com.nagam.interview.example.Introduction;

public class JavaFeatures {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Features of Java:");
        System.out.println("1. **Platform Independence:** Java code is compiled into bytecode which runs on any platform that has a JVM.");
        System.out.println("2. **Object-Oriented Programming:** Java is based on the principles of OOP, allowing for modular and reusable code.");
        System.out.println("3. **Simple Syntax:** Java's syntax is similar to C++, which makes it easy for developers to learn and use.");
        System.out.println("4. **Robust and Secure:** Java provides strong memory management and security features to prevent system crashes and malicious attacks.");
        System.out.println("5. **Multi-threading:** Java supports multi-threading for concurrent execution of multiple tasks.");
        System.out.println("6. **Automatic Memory Management:** Java uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory.");
        System.out.println("7. **Rich Standard Library:** Java has a comprehensive standard library that provides many useful utilities and APIs.");
        System.out.println("8. **Network-Centric:** Java is designed with network programming in mind, supporting a wide range of network protocols.");
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Java Class (`JavaFeatures.java`):** Contains a `main` method that prints the main features of Java.
- **README.md:** Describes the key features of Java and includes the example code for demonstration.
