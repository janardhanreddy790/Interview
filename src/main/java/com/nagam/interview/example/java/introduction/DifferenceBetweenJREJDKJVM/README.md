# Introduction

## Difference between JRE, JDK, and JVM in Java

Understanding the differences between JRE, JDK, and JVM is fundamental for Java developers. Each of these components plays a unique role in the Java ecosystem.

### 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- **Role:** JVM is an abstract machine that provides the runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It translates bytecode into machine code specific to the underlying operating system.
- **Platform Specific:** Different JVM implementations exist for various operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Purpose:** To provide a platform-independent execution environment for Java applications.

### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- **Role:** JRE provides the environment necessary to run Java applications. It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components required for running Java programs.
- **Components:** JRE consists of the JVM and standard Java class libraries.
- **Purpose:** To run Java applications but does not include tools for Java development, such as compilers or debuggers.

### 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)

- **Role:** JDK is a comprehensive toolkit for Java development. It includes everything found in JRE along with additional tools needed for Java programming.
- **Components:** JDK includes the JRE, Java compiler (`javac`), JavaDoc, Java Debugger, and other development tools.
- **Purpose:** To develop Java applications, providing all necessary tools for coding, debugging, and compiling Java programs.

### Example Code

The following Java class demonstrates a simple program that explains the differences between JRE, JDK, and JVM:

```java
package com.nagam.interview.example.Introduction;

public class JREJDKJVM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Differences between JRE, JDK, and JVM:");

        System.out.println("\n1. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**");
        System.out.println("   - JVM is an abstract machine that provides the runtime environment for Java bytecode to be executed.");
        System.out.println("   - It converts the bytecode into machine code, which the underlying operating system can execute.");
        System.out.println("   - JVM is platform-specific, meaning different JVM implementations exist for different operating systems.");

        System.out.println("\n2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**");
        System.out.println("   - JRE provides the environment necessary to run Java applications.");
        System.out.println("   - It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other components required for running Java programs.");
        System.out.println("   - JRE does not include development tools such as compilers or debuggers.");

        System.out.println("\n3. **JDK (Java Development Kit):**");
        System.out.println("   - JDK is a superset of JRE that includes everything found in JRE plus development tools.");
        System.out.println("   - It provides tools necessary for Java development, such as the Java compiler (`javac`), JavaDoc, and Java Debugger.");
        System.out.println("   - JDK is used to develop Java applications, whereas JRE is used to run them.");
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Java Class (`JREJDKJVM.java`):** Contains a `main` method that prints out the differences between JRE, JDK, and JVM.
- **README.md:** Provides a detailed explanation of each component (JVM, JRE, JDK) and includes the example code for illustration.
