# Introduction

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA). This means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

### Key Features of Java

- **Platform Independence:** Java code is compiled into bytecode which can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Object-Oriented:** Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, which allows for modular and reusable code.
- **Simple and Familiar:** Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it familiar to many developers, while it simplifies complex aspects of C++.
- **Secure:** Java provides a secure execution environment, with built-in security features to protect against malicious code.
- **Robust:** Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking, which contribute to its robustness.
- **Multi-threaded:** Java supports multi-threading, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple tasks.

### Example Code

The following Java class demonstrates a simple program that prints out a brief description of what Java is:

```java
package com.nagam.interview.example.Introduction;

public class WhatIsJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language " +
                           "that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. " +
                           "It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers " +
                           "write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all " +
                           "platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.");
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Java Class (`WhatIsJava.java`):** Contains a `main` method that prints out a brief description of Java.
- **README.md:** Provides a detailed explanation of what Java is, its key features, and includes the example code for illustration.

You can use these files in your project structure and open them in IntelliJ IDEA to execute and review the Java class. The `README.md` file helps explain the context and provide a detailed description of the code.
